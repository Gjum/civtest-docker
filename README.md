# Civtest Docker setup

Bundles all [Civtest](https://github.com/CivtestGame) mods with the modified server and a Postgres instance.

Requires `docker-compose` to be installed and the Docker daemon to be running.

## Run

`docker-compose up`

This starts the server and database, and displays logs until you press <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd>.
